
get the keywords file
    make the words into one list
    values of each word into a second list
    (MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE SAME INDEX NUMBER THOUGH)

get filename
    check to see if file exists
        exception handling
split tweets up into single tweets
(maybe use a for loop with i as the index number to make sure that all the indexes are matching up)
(or while writing the program, print the index of each step to check)
-use this value for lat/long later
    split each single tweet into words
        check to see if the word is a key word - if it is, add it to a new list of found keywords
        (using matching index numbers)
            calculate the total value of the keywords (make them ints)
            -sum(list) / # of keywords found (len of keywords found list - 1)
            -store this in a new list so that the total value index = original tweet index for lat/long function


lat/long function
-calculates the location of the tweet
-splits the file to get only the coordinates
-if statements to see which zone the tweet falls under
    use the list that has the total value of keywords
        -use indexes to add it to each zone
        -have a counter for the total number of tweets in each zone or use len(list) -1
        -if no tweets, then value = 0 (to avoid errors?)
